# DSA Learning Tutorial with Core Java

Welcome to the DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) learning tutorial with a focus on Core Java concepts. This tutorial covers a wide range of topics to help you build a strong foundation in both Java programming and DSA.

## Core Java Topics
1. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts:**
   - Classes
   - Objects
   - Inheritance
   - Polymorphism
   - Abstraction
   - Encapsulation

2. **Constructor:**
   - Types of Constructors
   - Constructor Overloading

3. **Exception Handling:**
   - Try, Catch, Finally blocks
   - Custom Exceptions
   - Exception Propagation

4. **Multithreading:**
   - Threads and Processes
   - Synchronization
   - Thread Safety

5. **Collection Framework:**
   - Lists, Sets, Maps
   - Iterators
   - Collections utility classes

6. **Packages:**
   - Creating and Using Packages
   - Access Modifiers

## Data Structures and Algorithms

1. **Arrays:**
   - Declaration and Initialization
   - Operations: Insertion, Deletion, Searching

2. **Linked Lists:**
   - Singly Linked Lists
   - Doubly Linked Lists
   - Circular Linked Lists

3. **Stacks:**
   - Operations: Push, Pop, Peek
   - Implementation using Arrays and Linked Lists

4. **Queues:**
   - Operations: Enqueue, Dequeue
   - Implementation using Arrays and Linked Lists

5. **Trees:**
   - Binary Trees
   - Binary Search Trees (BST)
   - Tree Traversals: Inorder, Preorder, Postorder

6. **Graphs:**
   - Representation: Adjacency Matrix, Adjacency List
   - Traversal: Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS)

7. **Sorting Algorithms:**
   - Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort
   - Merge Sort, Quick Sort

8. **Searching Algorithms:**
   - Linear Search, Binary Search
